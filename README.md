### Topic

This web application is a platform that uses favorite books as a way to match people. The application would allow users to create a profile and list their favorite books. Users would then be presented with potential matches based on their reading preferences.

The application would use a matching algorithm to suggest potential matches based on the books that users have in common. Users choose another user or not on potential matches, indicating whether they are interested in getting to know that person further.

In addition to the matching algorithm, the application could also have social networking features, allowing users to connect with each other. Users could also share their reading lists and book recommendations, helping to foster a community of like-minded book lovers.
